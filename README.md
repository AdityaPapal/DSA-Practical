DSA PRACTICAL QUESTIONS
1. Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to
quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques
and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone
numbers

2. To create ADT that implement the "set" concept. a. Add (newElement) -Place a value into
the set b. Remove (element) Remove the value c. Contains (element) Return true if element
is in collection d. Size () Return number of values in collection Iterator () Return an iterator
used to loop over collection e. Intersection of two sets f. Union of two sets g. Difference
between two sets h.Subset.

3. A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of subsections.
Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements of your method.

4. Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the
values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree - i. Insert new node ii. Find number
of nodes in longest path from root iii. Minimum data value found in the tree iv. Change a
tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node v. Search a
value.

5. Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and traverse
it using postorder traversal(non recursive) and then delete the entire tree.

6. There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then there
is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take to reach
city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The
node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list
representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Check
whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.

7. You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them up
with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to connect
different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum
total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.

8. Given sequence k = k1 <k2< …… <kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each
key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access
probability for each key?

9. A Dictionary stores keywords & its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords,
deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted
in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for
finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword.

10. Consider a scenario for Hospital to cater services to different kinds of patients as Serious
(top priority), b) non-serious (medium priority), c) General Checkup (Least priority).
Implement the priority queue to cater services to the patients.

11. Implement the Heap/Shell sort algorithm implemented in Java demonstrating heap/shell
data structure with modularity of programming language.

12. Company maintains employee information as employee ID, name, designation and salary.
Allow user to add, delete information of employee. Display information of particular
employee. If employee does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the
system displays the employee details. Use index sequential file to maintain the data.

13. Implementation of a direct access file -Insertion and deletion of a record from a direct access
file
